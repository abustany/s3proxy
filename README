Simple authenticating proxy for AWS S3
======================================

This proxy allows any application supporting HTTP proxies to access files in a
private S3 bucket. The authorization headers are only sent if the proxy detects
a S3 URL (of the form *.s3.amazonaws.com/*).

Build
=====
You'll need Go 1.1 to compile s3proxy. Note that the Go tools are only needed
for compiling s3proxy, the resulting binary does not depend on any external
libraries.

- Export GOPATH to the root directory of s3proxy
- Run go install s3proxy

You should now have a s3proxy binary in bin/s3proxy

Setup
=====
- Copy default.conf.dist to a file somewhere and edit the values inside
- Start the proxy, passing the path to the config file as the only command line
  parameter

Future
======
- Support multiple bucket configurations (one API key per bucket)
- Support transparent client side encryption of data
