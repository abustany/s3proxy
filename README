Simple authenticating proxy for AWS S3
======================================

This proxy allows any application supporting HTTP proxies to access files in a
private S3 bucket. The authorization headers are only sent if the proxy detects
a S3 URL (of the form *.s3.amazonaws.com/*).

The proxy supports fetching tokens from an IAM role, so you don't have to store
the keys on your instance directly. You can also configure different buckets
with different credentials.

Build
=====
You'll need Go 1.1 to compile s3proxy. Note that the Go tools are only needed
for compiling s3proxy, the resulting binary does not depend on any external
libraries.

- Export GOPATH to the root directory of s3proxy
- Run go install s3proxy

You should now have a s3proxy binary in bin/s3proxy

Setup
=====
- Copy config.json.dist to a file somewhere and edit the values inside
- Start the proxy, passing the path to the config file as the only command line
  parameter

Future
======
- Support transparent client side encryption of data
